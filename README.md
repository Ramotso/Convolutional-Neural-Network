# Aircraft Detection and Recognition

This Python code is designed to perform object detection and recognition on images of military aircraft. It utilizes various computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify and classify different types of aircraft.

## Prerequisites

Before running this code, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- Pillow (PIL)
- scikit-image (skimage)
- TensorFlow
- Keras

Additionally, you will need to have the "military-aircraft-recognition-dataset" available, which contains the images and annotations for training and testing.

## Code Structure

The code consists of several sections, each performing a specific task:

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: This section loads and visualizes the dataset, including the images and their corresponding annotations (bounding boxes and labels).

2. **Selective Search Algorithm**: The code implements the Selective Search algorithm, which is used to generate region proposals (potential object locations) within the images. This algorithm is based on hierarchical grouping and similarity calculations.

3. **Feature Extraction**: The code utilizes pre-trained deep learning models, such as VGG16, to extract features from the region proposals. These features will be used for object classification.

4. **Object Detection and Recognition**: This section combines the region proposals and extracted features to train a deep learning model for object detection and recognition. It includes steps for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage

1. Download the "military-aircraft-recognition-dataset" and place it in the appropriate location.

2. Run the code sequentially, as each section builds upon the previous one.

3. Adjust the paths and configurations as needed to match your local environment and dataset location.

4. Optionally, you can modify the code to experiment with different deep learning models, hyperparameters, or evaluation metrics.

## Output

The code will generate visualizations and performance metrics related to object detection and recognition on the military aircraft dataset. The specific outputs may include:

- Visualizations of the region proposals and bounding boxes overlaid on the input images.
- Plots and statistics related to the performance of the object detection and recognition model (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).
- Saved models or checkpoints for further use or evaluation.

Note: Due to the complexity of the code and the data preprocessing steps, the execution time may vary depending on your hardware and dataset size.
